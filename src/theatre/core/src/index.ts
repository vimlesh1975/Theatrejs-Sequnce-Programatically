      Another core bundle is registered. This usually means the bundler is not configured correctly and
      is bundling `@theatre/core` multiple times, but, there are legitimate scenarios where a user may want
      to include multiple instances of `@theatre/core` on the same page.

      For example, an article might embed two separate interactive graphics that
      are made by different teams (and even different tech stacks -- one in JS, the other in clojurescript).

      If both of those graphics use Theatre.js, our current setup makes them conflict with one another.
